Poke Bowl: A Hawaiian-inspired dish with raw marinated fish, rice, vegetables, and a variety of toppings like seaweed, crispy onions, and avocado. It's a fresh and colorful meal, offering a unique twist on traditional sushi.
Veggie-Loaded Pasta: Create a pasta dish with a twist by using spiralized vegetables like zucchini or carrots as the 'noodles'. Top it with a creamy cashew sauce, roasted cherry tomatoes, and a sprinkle of nutritional yeast for a cheesy flavor. This dish is a fun way to increase vegetable intake. 
Fruit Charcuterie Board: Instead of a typical charcuterie board with meats and cheeses, create a sweet version with an assortment of fresh fruits, dark chocolate dips, nut butter, and a selection of nuts and seeds. It's an aesthetically pleasing and healthy snack or dessert option.
