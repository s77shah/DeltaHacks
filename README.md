## **About the Project**  
NutriGram was created during DeltaHacks XI to combine food-sharing with cultural and social connectivity. Itâ€™s a platform where users can upload pictures of their meals, share captions, and engage with a community of like-minded individuals.

The app emphasizes social connection through food, aiming to bring together food enthusiasts while providing personalized meal recommendations to users through AI-driven insights.

As a team, we challenged ourselves to step out of our comfort zones by working with entirely new frameworks and languages. This was our first time utilizing the tech stack, including Swift, Auth0, and Cohere AI, which made the development process a tremendous learning experience.
